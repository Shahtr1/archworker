## Architecture

Archworker uses a monolithic architecture for the core application, supplemented by individual microservices for each supported language/framework.

### Core Application (Monolithic Architecture)

- **Functionality**: Handles user registration, authentication, session management, project configuration processing, and communication with language/framework-specific microservices.
- **Technology Stack**: Java for the backend, Angular for the frontend UI, Mysql for data storage, and RESTful APIs for internal and external communication.

### Microservices

- **Initial Microservices**: Spring Boot Microservice for backend setup and Angular Microservice for frontend setup.
- **Functionality**: Responsible for generating boilerplate code and specific configurations.

### User Interface (UI)

- **Technology**: Angular.
- **Functionality**: Interface for user registration, login, project setup, and technology selection.

### Database

- **Role**: Stores user data, project configurations, and operational information.
- **Choice**: PostgreSQL or a similar relational database management system.

### Deployment and Management

- **Containerization**: Docker for containerizing the application and microservices.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing containers.

## Future Expansion Considerations

- **Code Flexibility**: Write code for future scalability and potential refactoring into microservices.
- **Plugin System**: Implement a system within the monolith for easy integration of new languages/frameworks.

## Workflow Summary

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the Angular-based UI to create a new project.
2. **Core Application Processing**: Authenticates users and processes project creation requests.
3. **Code Generation and Delivery**: Microservices return the generated code to the core application, which compiles it into a complete project structure for the user.
